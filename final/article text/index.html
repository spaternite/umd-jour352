<p>Rowe grew up in Maplewood, NJ and released her first EP in 2012. Since her debut album in 2017, she has worked with artists like Rihanna, Kendrick Lamar, Travis Scott, Nicki Manaj, and more.</p>

<p>CTRL has been on the Billboard 200 chart for 311 weeks and has 49.52 listens total (as of June 2o23). She holds 27 awards among 69 nominations, ranging from the Grammys, Academy Awards, Billboard Music Awards, American Music Awards, MTV music video awards, and lots more.</p>


<p>She released her second album “SOS” in December 2022, which led to her second world tour that blew up the internet and Ticketmaster. </p>

<p>Ticketmaster shows her concert tickets range from hundreds to thousands of dollars. For her upcoming concert on December 8th at Madison Square Garden in New York, NY, she will be performing at Z100’s Jingle Ball. Ticket prices range from roughly $230 to $1,700. Articles say her concert ticket prices are attributed to her popularity, how often she goes on tour (not often) and all her awards.</p>

<p>Her tour consists of multiple performances per city in North and South America, Europe, and Canada. </p>

<p>She was rumored to be dating Travis Scott in the beginning of the summer due to their performances together, but has since subsided. There are no current reports demonstrating a possible relationship.</p>

<p>She plans to release more music by the end of 2023. At a free event hosted in Brooklyn, NY to celebrate her album, she told the audience her new album is called “Lana” and will include 7-10 never before heard songs.  The album is meant to serve as a sophomore deluxe version of her latest album “SOS.”
