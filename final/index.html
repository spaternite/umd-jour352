<p>Ticketmaster shows her concert tickets range from hundreds to thousands of dollars. For her upcoming concert on December 8th at Madison Square Garden in New York, NY, she will be performing at Z100’s Jingle Ball. Ticket prices range from roughly $230 to $1,700. Articles say her concert ticket prices are attributed to her popularity, how often she goes on tour (not often) and all her awards.</p>
<p>Her tour consists of multiple performances per city in North and South America, Europe, and Canada. </p>
